## Idea

Built in 36 hours for Bitcamp 2018, Flock is a web application that replaces the insurance broker. Instead of paying premiums to an insurance company and hope that your claims go unfought, you pay into a clustered pool that is used exclusively for medical bills. Using a reward system for correct claim assessment, we have built in a delegate system that audits claims and releases funds in times of need. Flock is not in control of your funds at any point, instead choosing to delegate power to decentralized communities in determining risk, premiums, deductibles, and other aspects of traditional insurance. Without a large company as middleman, the amount we save on wages and fees are directly passed to users.

## Code 

This is a multiple page React.js web application built using React Router, as well as Firebase for authentication. Users have profiles linked to firebase, and an authentication system is fully set up. The application is composed of custom React components as well as some Semantic UI React components. Items are currently hard-coded, but can accept props.
